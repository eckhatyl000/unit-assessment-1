// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning//
//Analysis Of requirements//
//Design//
//Implementation//
//Testing and Intergration//
//Maintain//


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements = "This step involves gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. Stakeholders' needs are analyzed to ensure the software will meet their expectations and solve any identified problems.";

const design = "In this phase, the software's architecture and user interface are designed. Developers create diagrams, models, and prototypes to represent the structure, components, and data flow of the software.";

const implementation = "During this step, developers write the actual code for the software, following the design and architecture established in the previous steps. This phase involves programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software.";

const testingAndIntegration = "This step involves testing individual components and integrating them to ensure the software functions as expected. Developers perform various types of tests to identify and fix errors, improve performance, and ensure the software meets the defined requirements.";

const maintain = "After the software is deployed, this phase focuses on resolving issues, providing updates, and making improvements based on user feedback. Regular maintenance is crucial for the software's stability and long-term success.";
